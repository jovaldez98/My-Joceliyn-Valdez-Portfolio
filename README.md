# My-Joceliyn-Valdez-Portfolio

## Description

This project was to code my own porfolio from scratch. Using the mock up of the porfolio "Lernantino" as a model to build my own porfolio. This porfolio will continue to be built further throughout the next five months to add projects done during the Bootcamp. It is also to showcase coding skills for potential employers. Used core skills such as flexbox, media queries and CSS variables on portfolio. The portfolio has a header, the links leading to the corresponding "About Me," "My Work," "Contact Me" and "Resume," sections, images to represent future projects, and a footer at the end.
